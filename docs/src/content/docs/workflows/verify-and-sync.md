A copperhead repo is healthy when the KiCad files, the design docs, and the constraint registry all agree. Two commands police that: `check` detects disagreement, `sync` resolves it.

## `check`: detect, deterministically

`check` (alias `verify`) runs ERC, DRC, doc-drift detection, constraint checks, and spec validation. It makes **no LLM calls and no network requests**, which is a contract, not a tendency: this is what makes it safe to run in CI and in a pre-commit hook.

```bash
copperhead check
```

It exits 0 when everything agrees and 1 when it does not. Drift is reported in the form "this doc claims X but the actual value is Y".

`init` installs a pre-commit hook that runs it, so hand edits that desync the docs, the constraint registry, or the schematic fail at commit time. In CI, add the same command as a step; with `--json` it prints a result object with per-check detail.

## `sync`: resolve, under truth precedence

`sync` has two phases: a deterministic verify phase, then an LLM resolve phase. It reconciles the design state under a fixed notion of which source wins:

- **KiCad files are as-built facts.** What the schematic and board actually say is what is true.
- **Specs and budgets are requirements.** What the design is supposed to satisfy.

```bash
copperhead sync --dry-run   # print the inconsistency report, write nothing
copperhead sync             # resolve drift
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Clean, or drift resolved successfully. |
| `1` | The resolve phase failed. |
| `2` | Requirement violations found. |

Exit code 2 is the important one. A requirement violation means the as-built design contradicts a stated requirement, and copperhead will **never** auto-resolve that: the fix is an engineering decision, not a bookkeeping one. Drift, where the docs disagree with the files, is resolvable and gets resolved.
