# Proposal: Build copperhead Phase 1

## Why

Hardware design has no equivalent of a coding agent: every schematic change is manual, docs drift from the design immediately, and nothing verifies that a change respects the product's constraints. copperhead (per `openspec/specs/SPEC.md`) closes that gap — an AI agent that edits real KiCad files, keeps design docs as memory, and gates every edit behind a validated spec proposal and an ERC/DRC pass. Phase 1 delivers the complete CLI and agent core; the repo today contains only the spec, so everything must be built.

## What Changes

- Scaffold the TypeScript/Node ≥ 20 project: `package.json` (bin: `copperhead`), `tsconfig.json`, `.env.example`, test fixture KiCad project.
- Implement the CLI surface: `copperhead create`, `init`, `do`, `check` (alias `verify`), `sync`, with global flags `--repo`, `--dry-run`, `--json` (`explain` is stretch, `watch` is Phase 2 — out of scope).
- Implement `copperhead sync`: verify the entire design state for inconsistencies (doc tables vs schematic, constraints.json vs docs and specs, PINOUT.md vs pins.h, decision/changelog coverage) and resolve the drift via a spec-gated agent run — with a truth-precedence rule that never silently rewrites a requirement violation (SPEC.md AC-7).
- Implement the provider-agnostic agent loop (OpenAI GPT-5 + Anthropic Claude behind one `Provider` interface) with turn budgets, repair cycles, retry/backoff, and provider failover.
- Implement KiCad tooling: `kicad-cli` subprocess wrapper for ERC/DRC/SVG export, minimal s-expression reader (read-only: symbols/nets), and ERC/DRC report parser producing structured violations.
- Implement docs-as-memory: `init` scaffolds `docs/` (SPEC/BOM/PINOUT/SUBSYSTEMS/LAYOUT.md) pre-filled from the parsed schematic; `check_drift` compares doc claims against the schematic.
- Make agent memory user-viewable, not a black box: an append-only `docs/DECISIONS.md` log of every agent decision with rationale, a per-run design changelog (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`), a human-readable `summary.md` per run alongside the JSONL transcript, and a generated `.copperhead/README.md` documenting every config key and the memory layout.
- Implement an event-driven sync layer so nothing goes stale: post-edit hooks inside the loop record sync obligations (drift check, constraint dual-write, `affects` revisit, decision-log and changelog entries) that MUST clear before the run may commit; `init` installs a git pre-commit hook running `copperhead check` so human edits are held to the same bar.
- Implement spec-gated editing: the agent drives OpenSpec as a subprocess; `edit_file`/`write_file` tools are absent from the tool list until `openspec validate --change <id>` passes; constraint registry `.copperhead/constraints.json` built alongside docs.
- Implement the Mode A `create` pipeline: brief → seeded specs → architecture → BOM → schematic → first-draft layout → outputs package (gerbers, DXF/STEP, renders, order BOM) → firmware scaffold → DEVPLAN.md, with run-to-completion guarantee and `--interactive` gates.
- Implement safety rails: repo-root path sandboxing, dirty-tree refusal, snapshot/rollback on failure, an explicit `--keep-on-fail` debugging escape hatch that skips cleanup without permitting success or commit, secret redaction in transcripts, `UNVERIFIED` flagging of invented parts.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `cli-surface`: The `copperhead` command set (`create`, `init`, `do`, `check`, `sync`), global flags, exit codes, and JSON output mode — including the full-state consistency verify-and-resolve command.
- `agent-core`: The provider-agnostic LLM tool-use loop — provider abstraction, tool schemas and dispatch, system prompt rules, turn/repair budgets, failure handling, and the post-edit hook/obligations engine that blocks commit until docs, constraints, and logs are in sync.
- `kicad-tooling`: kicad-cli wrapper (ERC, DRC, SVG export), read-only s-expression parsing (`list_symbols`, `list_nets`), and structured violation reports.
- `docs-memory`: docs/ scaffolding from a real schematic (`init`), the docs-as-memory convention, doc-vs-schematic drift checking, the user-viewable decision log (`docs/DECISIONS.md`) and design changelog (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`), the self-describing `.copperhead/README.md`, and git pre-commit hook installation.
- `spec-gating`: OpenSpec-driven change workflow (propose → validate → edit-unlock → archive) and the machine-readable constraint registry with `affects` propagation.
- `create-pipeline`: Mode A end-to-end pipeline from `brief.md` to the full output package, firmware scaffold, and DEVPLAN.md, resumable and run-to-completion.
- `safety-rails`: Path sandboxing, git-state preconditions, snapshot/rollback, secret hygiene, no-invented-MPN policy, and human-readable per-run summaries in the audit trail.

### Modified Capabilities

None — no per-capability specs exist yet (`openspec/specs/` holds only the source technical spec document).

## Impact

- New source tree under `src/` (cli, agent/, kicad/, memory/, util/), `test/fixtures/`, and project config files — all greenfield.
- Runtime dependencies: commander, OpenAI SDK, Anthropic SDK, execa (subprocess), ripgrep-style search; dev: TypeScript, a test runner (vitest), tsx.
- External requirements: `kicad-cli` ≥ 8 on PATH; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via env only; `openspec` CLI available in target repos.
- Acceptance is defined by SPEC.md §9 (AC-1 … AC-4, AC-6, AC-7); priority order AC-3.4 > AC-3.2 > AC-3.1 > AC-2.1 > AC-1.2.
